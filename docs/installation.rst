Alternatives & Updates
----------------------

To install Physiofit 2.0 for the current user account only, run the following command:

.. code-block::

    pip install --user physiofit

This will ensure that the package and dependencies are installed to your user's home directory instead of a system
directory, which does not require any special privileges.

Once the package is installed, you can update it using the following command:

.. code-block::

    pip install -U physiofit
