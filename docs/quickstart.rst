.. seealso:: If you have already used Physiofit and are looking for a more in-depth tutorial, check out the :doc:`usage`
             section.

In this section we will explain how to launch your first job one Physiofit has been installed onto your system.

Launching the Graphical User Interface
--------------------------------------

To launch the graphical user interface or GUI, open up your preferred command-line utility and type in "physiofit". If
you installed the package in a specific environment, make sure to navigate into it first before launching the command.
The app should launch inside your default web browser as such:

Launching your first job
------------------------

After having launched the GUI, the app will be opened in a new browser window. It will prompt you to select an input
data file, which can be a .tsv file containing the data or a json configuration file containing the run parameters and
a path towards the data (see :doc:`usage` for more details).
