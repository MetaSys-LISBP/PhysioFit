             section.

In this section we will explain how to launch your first job once PhysioFit has been installed onto your system.

Graphical User Interface
--------------------------------------

To launch the graphical user interface or GUI, open up your preferred command-line utility and type:

.. code-block:: bash

  physiofit
 
If you installed the package in a specific environment, make sure to be in this environment before starting PhysioFit.

PhysioFit interface will open in a new browser window. It will prompt you to select an input
data file, which can be a .tsv file containing the data or a json configuration file containing the run parameters and
a path towards the data (see :doc:`usage` for more details).
